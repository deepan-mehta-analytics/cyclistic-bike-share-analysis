# 🚲 Cyclistic Bike-Share Analysis

### Strategic Analysis of User Behaviour for Membership Conversion

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project performs an end-to-end data analysis of Cyclistic (Divvy Bike Share) trip data to identify behavioral differences between **casual riders** and **annual members**.

The objective is to generate actionable insights that support **membership conversion strategies**, improving long-term revenue stability.

---

## 🎯 Business Problem

Cyclistic’s business model depends on increasing the number of annual members.

The key analytical question addressed:

> **How do casual riders and members use Cyclistic bikes differently, and how can these insights inform targeted conversion strategies?**

---

## 📊 Dataset

* **Source:** Divvy Bike Share
* **Period:** 2019 Q1 & 2020 Q1
* **Records:** ~791,000 (cleaned to ~778,000)
* **Format:** CSV (provided as compressed ZIP files)

### Key Fields:

* Ride timestamps (start/end)
* Station information
* Ride duration
* User classification (Member / Casual)

---

## ⚙️ ETL Pipeline (Python)

A structured ETL pipeline was implemented using **Pandas** to ensure data quality, consistency, and reproducibility.

### 🔹 Extraction

* Loaded multiple datasets (2019 & 2020)
* Identified schema inconsistencies

### 🔹 Transformation

* Standardized column naming conventions
* Converted datetime fields
* Merged datasets into a unified dataframe

### 🔹 Feature Engineering

* `ride_length` (minutes)
* `day_of_week`
* `hour`
* `time_period` (Morning / Afternoon / Evening / Night)
* `ride_category` (Short / Medium / Long)

### 🔹 Cleaning

* Removed invalid and negative durations
* Filtered extreme outliers (> 90 minutes)
* Standardized user types into:

  * **Member**
  * **Casual**

The pipeline was designed with a focus on **reproducibility and structured data processing**, aligning with data engineering best practices.

## 📈 Exploratory Data Analysis

The analysis explores user behavior across multiple dimensions:

* Ride volume distribution
* Average ride duration
* Weekly usage patterns
* Hourly ride trends
* Time-of-day segmentation
* Ride length categorization

## 🔍 Key Findings

* **Members dominate ride volume (~92%)**, indicating strong adoption among regular users
* **Casual riders take longer trips (~26 min vs ~11 min)**, suggesting leisure usage
* **Members ride during weekdays**, aligned with commuting behavior
* **Casual users peak on weekends and afternoons**, indicating recreational usage
* **Members prefer short rides**, while casual users engage more in medium/long rides

---

## 💡 Business Recommendations

* 🎯 Target casual riders during **weekends and afternoons**
* 🎯 Introduce **membership discounts for long-duration users**
* 🎯 Offer **ride bundles or trial memberships**
* 🎯 Design campaigns around **leisure usage patterns**
